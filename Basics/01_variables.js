These are two mathods where I Stock, mean comparisan in these two are really tiny(little).
JavaScript Identifiers let, var and const when use in a first way |Acount = | Undifined is throw in the terminal if we Execute it, also not error throw if not execute.
In another way |Account; | if we write, only can declared by  except const then undifiend you will see in the terminal, const constant tell you Missing initializer in const declaration.
*/
/*
 1. When value is known only we use var, because it is Globelly Scope Identifier. Morever for that issue let and const is came.
 2. Variable or Constant is not use for same value, and for same value not using the different declaration except var.
 3. A lot of confusion is created when we use var , So by var declaration is ignored, it is not a bad idea.
 4. Best technique is avoid same declaration , and take the some meaningfull identifiers and should be change from rest of the identifiers
